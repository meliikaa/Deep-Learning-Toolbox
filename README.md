# Deep-Learning-Toolbox


This repository contains a collection of projects showcasing various aspects of deep learning and neural networks. Each project addresses specific challenges and techniques within the field of artificial intelligence. Below, you'll find an overview of each project:

## 1. Overfitting and Regularization
In this section, we delve into the critical issue of overfitting, which arises when the model performs exceedingly well on the training dataset but fails to generalize to new, unseen examples. Through a soccer-themed example, I demonstrate the implications of overfitting and the importance of regularization techniques. You'll learn how to apply regularization to your deep learning models, providing a solution to combat overfitting and improve generalization.

## 2. Initialization Techniques
Effective weight initialization is crucial for the training process of neural networks. In this project, we explore different initialization methods, including random, zeros, and He initialization. By experimenting with these techniques, you'll grasp how each initialization impacts convergence speed and the network's ability to reach lower training and generalization errors.

## 3. Gradient Checking for Fraud Detection
Building on the scenario of global mobile payments, this project addresses the need for rigorous testing of backpropagation implementation, especially in critical applications like fraud detection. You'll learn about gradient checking, a validation method that verifies the correctness of backpropagation. Through practical exercises, you'll gain confidence in the reliability of your backpropagation implementation.

## 4. Optimization Methods
Optimization lies at the heart of training neural networks effectively. This project focuses on key optimization methods such as (Stochastic) Gradient Descent, Momentum, RMSProp, and Adam. By working with random minibatches and exploring various optimization techniques, you'll understand how each method impacts convergence speed and optimization performance.

## 5. TensorFlow Introduction
Transitioning from Numpy to TensorFlow, this project introduces you to the powerful TensorFlow 2.3 framework. You'll learn how to use `tf.Variable` to modify variable states, comprehend the distinction between variables and constants, and develop a neural network trained on a TensorFlow dataset. This project empowers you to leverage the capabilities of TensorFlow to enhance your deep learning development.

## 6. Sign Language Digits Recognition
In this section, we apply the knowledge gained from the previous projects to a real-world problem: recognizing sign language digits. By working with a dataset containing six different classes representing digits 0 to 5, you'll practically apply deep learning techniques to build a model capable of classifying sign language digits accurately.

Feel free to explore each project folder to find detailed implementation, code, and explanations for the topics covered in these projects. Happy learning and experimenting with the exciting world of deep learning and neural networks!
